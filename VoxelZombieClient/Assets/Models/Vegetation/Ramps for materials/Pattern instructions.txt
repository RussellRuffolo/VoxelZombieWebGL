     HOW TO USE
---------------------

Apply these to the "albedo" section of a shader!
The UVs of each object are set up to automatically find the
part of the image that corresponds to the color they need.


-----------------------
 TO MAKE YOUR OWN:
-----------------------
Just create a new file, 256x256, and divide it into a 4-by-4 grid.

NOTE: Spaces 8 and 14 are unused. Plans with their squares were scrapped for the final UVs.
Any changes to those squares will not be reflected in the final color of the object.

Here's what each square corresponds to:
---------------
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
--------------|
5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
--------------|
9 | 10| 11| 12|
--------------|
13| 14| 15| 16|
